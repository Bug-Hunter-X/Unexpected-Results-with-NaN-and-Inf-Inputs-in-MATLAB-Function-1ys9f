This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MATLAB related to handling NaN (Not a Number) and Inf (Infinity) values as function inputs. The function `myFunction` is designed to perform different calculations based on the input value, but it fails to handle NaN and Inf correctly, leading to unexpected results. The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version that addresses this issue.
